So this is for stm32h7 with usb ulpi for usbhs, Its using experimental libopencm3 support for a lot of hardware, checkoutmy fork of libopencm3 for qspi/spi/i2c/m4 core/ etc support. Needless to say the libopencm3 version found in this repo is required for this firmware. Currently my limited testing shows everything working scanning/send/receive etc. Its currently fixed at 400k, and needs sum cleanups and tweaks. Once I look into live changing the pll3 divisers Ill add some way to change the frequency, 1m should be feasible. The linux kernel driver i2c-tiny-usb is old or at least based off old hardware and what not. So instead of a normal freq selection it uses delay. I patch my kernels driver for some helpful stuff if i remember ill throw a patch or a copy up here. The original should absolutely be used instead of this one. I do have some other version for f1 f4 with usb-2-serial usb-2-serial with IRQ support using homebrew linux drivers, plus usb-to-adc etc. All in my repos github.com/bm16ton. Good enuff for initial commit
